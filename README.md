GooseMedia is a decentralized social media web page created using Lens Protocol! 

The product hosts social media services with Lens Protocol which is built on the product-of-stake blockchain from Polygon. It leverages the Lens API to create a safe, and most secure social media app. When the user creates their account and then they'll receive a unique identifying NFT.

We used Lens protocol, the Lens GraphQL API, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. We used queries to access data such as profiles and publications. We then fetched these using the API and used the data extracted on our social media page. Afterwards, we created the frontend using typescript and utilized the data extracted such as profile pictures.
